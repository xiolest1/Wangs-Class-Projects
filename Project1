Steps
1.Input:
	a.floors
	b.rooms
	c.occupiedRooms
	
	
2.Processing:
	a.totalRooms = floors*rooms
	b.totalOccupied += occupied
	c.percentOccupied = (totalOccupied * 1.0f /totalRooms ) * 100.0f;
	d.totalEmpty = totalRooms - totalOccupied
	
3.Output
	a.totalFloors
	b.totalRooms
	c.totalOccupied
	d.totalEmpty
	e.percentOccupied
